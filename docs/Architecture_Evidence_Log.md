# Architecture Evidence Log

**Purpose:** empirical record of whether [ADR-0016](adr/0016-enterprise-ai-os-architecture.md)'s
governance survives contact with implementation. **This is not an ADR** and carries no authority -
it records observations. A change to Rules 1-5 or GP-1/GP-2 requires a *superseding ADR*.

Five rules were induced from a single subsystem (Authentication), so whether they generalise is
unknown. These records are the experiment.

## How to use this

**Write the Prediction section before implementation begins.** A rule marked ✓ after the fact is
nearly unfalsifiable - it is easy to conclude a rule held once the outcome is known. Stating the
falsification conditions up front makes the result binding.

**A ✗ is a successful experiment, not a project failure.** It means a rule gave real information
about where an abstraction was wrong, which is the entire reason for running it. A model that
records no ✗ across several milestones is more likely to be unfalsifiable than correct.

## Evidence Record: Phase 4 Slice 2 — Agent Runtime — Type: Foundation

> **Evidence strength: WEAK.** The prediction below was **reconstructed after implementation**,
> not written in advance. A post-hoc prediction cannot falsify anything - it is written knowing the
> outcome. Recorded for completeness and to show the rules being exercised, but it carries less
> weight than Tool Registry's, whose prediction *was* written first. This is the last record that
> will have this weakness.

### PREDICTION *(reconstructed 2026-07-19, after implementation)*

**Rules exercised:** Rule 3 (typed domain objects), Rule 4 (a seam is unproven until one real
implementation exists), Rule 5 (a protocol may evolve only through an active consumer).

**Falsification conditions**

- If `AgentRoutingStage` had required changes to `PipelineStage`'s *members*, **Rule 1's admission
  test would have been wrong** — the seam would not have anticipated its own first consumer.
- If any protocol had changed without an active consumer demanding it, **Rule 5 failed**.
- If a guard passed without ever being observed failing, **the enforcement was theatre**.

**Expected outcome:** the runtime becomes a pipeline stage against unchanged protocols; four
guards each observed failing before being trusted.

### OBSERVED *(after Gate 2, 2026-07-19)*

**Gate 2: PASS** — 206 passed, 0 skipped, 95% coverage, mypy strict clean (138 files),
import-linter 13 kept / 0 broken.

| Rule | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Rule 3 — typed domain objects | ✓ | `RoutingDecision` and `StageResult` are agreed on by runtime, stage and future consumers; disagreement would be silent, which is the trigger test |
| Rule 4 — seam unproven until implemented | ✓ **strong** | `AgentRoutingStage`, the first real consumer of `PipelineStage`, surfaced a defect the protocol alone had not exposed (see below) |
| Rule 5 — protocol evolves only via active consumer | ✓ | One protocol change occurred, driven by an active consumer, and was surfaced rather than made silently |

### Unexpected observations

**1. Rule 4 paid out immediately (protocol defect).** `PipelineStage` was missing
`@runtime_checkable`, while `BaseAgent` had it. Nothing revealed this until a consumer tried to
assert conformance and mypy rejected `isinstance()`. The protocol *looked* complete in isolation.
This is the clearest evidence so far that Rule 4 is doing real work rather than adding ceremony.

**Rule 5 classification:** this was a genuine protocol change driven by an active consumer, so
Rule 5 was triggered and satisfied. It added no members and corrected an inconsistency rather than
evolving the interface, so **no superseding ADR is warranted** — but it is recorded here rather
than left silent, which is the behaviour Rule 5 exists to produce.

**2. Governance caught protocol drift but NOT responsibility drift.** The first implementation of
`AgentRoutingStage` returned `BLOCK` on a non-selection, embedding execution control into the
seam's first consumer. Every rule and every guard passed. It was caught by **human review**, not by
governance, and would have forced rework once Policy, Evaluation and Reflection became stages.

This is a real gap: Rules 1-5 govern *whether a seam exists, how it is introduced, when it is
typed, when it is proven, and when it may change* — none govern **where a responsibility belongs**.
Recorded as an observation only. Per ADR-0016, no Rule 6 is proposed; if this recurs in Tool
Registry or MCP, that becomes evidence under GP-1 and justifies a superseding ADR.

**3. Guard 1 could not be expressed with import-linter.** The forbidden operation is
*instantiation*, not *import* — legitimate consumers must import `RoutingDecision` to read it.
Required a separate AST-based scan. Worth remembering when designing future guards: "which tool
answers this question?" is a real design step, not a formality.

### Decision

**No action.** ADR-0016 stands unchanged. No superseding ADR required.

### Lessons

- A seam is not proven by review; it is proven by a consumer. Rule 4 earned its place here.
- Rules constrain *structure* well and *responsibility placement* not at all. Human review remains
  load-bearing for the latter — do not assume green gates mean a correct design.
- Choose the enforcement tool from the question being asked. Import graphs, AST scans and
  conformance tests answer different questions, and using the wrong one yields a guard that passes
  while checking nothing.

## Evidence Record: Tool Registry — Type: Foundation

### PREDICTION *(written before implementation, 2026-07-19)*

**Rules exercised:** Rule 4 (a seam is unproven until one real implementation exists),
Rule 5 (a protocol may evolve only through an active consumer).

**Falsification conditions**

- If adding a **second** registry backend requires changing `ToolRegistry`, **Rule 4 was wrong** —
  one implementation was not sufficient to prove the shape, and the rule should demand two.
- If any field is added to `ToolDescriptor` without an active consumer needing it,
  **Rule 5 failed to prevent speculative evolution**.
- If the milestone ships without an ADR, the Foundation/Capability classification is not doing its
  job as a reviewer check.

**Expected outcome:** a second implementation lands against the **unchanged** protocol.
`InMemoryToolRegistry` already forced two decisions the interface left open (newest-version
resolution on unversioned `get()`, fail-closed `permitted()`), which is Rule 4 working as intended.

### OBSERVED *(after Gate 2, 2026-07-19)*

> **Evidence strength: STRONG.** This is the first milestone whose prediction was written **before**
> implementation. Unlike Slices 1 and 2, the result below could have come out otherwise.

**Gate 2: PASS** — 252 passed, 0 skipped, 95% coverage, mypy strict clean,
import-linter 15 kept / 0 broken.

| Falsification condition | Fired? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Second backend requires changing `ToolRegistry` ⇒ **Rule 4 wrong** | **No** | `StaticManifestToolRegistry` satisfies all four methods; `application/ports/tools.py` untouched |
| Field added to `ToolDescriptor` without an active consumer ⇒ **Rule 5 failed** | **No** | No field added. Rule 5 not triggered |
| Milestone ships without an ADR ⇒ classification not working | **Unevaluable** | See below — the condition was ill-specified |

| Rule | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Rule 4 — a seam is unproven until one real implementation exists | ✓ **strong** | One implementation *was* sufficient: a second backend with a different storage model fit unchanged, and a real consumer ran against the protocol alone |
| Rule 5 — protocol evolves only via an active consumer | ✓ **not triggered** | `ToolCatalog` was implementable without any protocol change |

### Unexpected observations

**1. One of my own falsification conditions was badly written.** *"If the milestone ships without an
ADR, the classification is not doing its job"* could not be evaluated. Tool Registry is a Foundation
milestone but **completed** a seam that ADR-0016 already introduced — it did not create a new one, so
no new ADR was warranted. The condition conflated *creating* a seam with *finishing* one.

**A condition that cannot fire is not a falsification condition.** The two conditions that were
concrete (protocol change, field addition) produced real evidence; the vague one produced none. When
writing the MCP prediction, every condition must name an observable artifact and state which
observation would count as failure.

**2. Guard C needed an AST scan, not import-linter — the second occurrence of this pattern.** Guard A
already forbids consumers *importing* implementations, but the composition root must import them
legitimately, so the open question was *who calls the constructor*. Same shape as Guard 1
(`RoutingDecision`) in Slice 2. Two instances now: **"which tool answers this question?" is a design
step, not a formality.** Import graphs and AST scans answer different questions, and reaching for the
familiar one yields a guard that passes while checking nothing.

**3. Guard C currently constrains no production code.** Nothing constructs a registry yet — container
wiring was out of scope. Its deliberate-violation proof shows it bites, so it is not theatre, but it
becomes load-bearing only when a composition-root wiring exists. Recorded rather than glossed,
because "passes because nothing exercises it" is the exact failure mode this project keeps finding.

**4. Rule 4 paid out again, quietly.** Building the second backend forced a decision the protocol left
open: whether a manifest-seeded registry should accept `register()`. Refusing would have been *partial
conformance* — a backend silently not implementing part of the contract. The parity tests exist to
catch precisely that.

### Decision

**No action.** ADR-0016 stands unchanged. No superseding ADR required.

### Lessons

- **Rule 4 holds under a genuine test.** One implementation proved the seam; the second fit unchanged.
  This is the strongest evidence to date that the governance generalises beyond Authentication.
- **Write falsification conditions against observable artifacts.** Two of three were usable; the third
  was prose. Predictions are only as good as their sharpest condition.
- **Match the enforcement tool to the question.** Second confirmation that dependency checks and
  construction checks are different problems.

## Evidence Record: MCP Gateway — Type: Foundation

### PREDICTION *(written before implementation, 2026-07-19)*

**Rules exercised:** Rule 1 (invariant admission test), Rule 4, Rule 5.

**Falsification conditions**

- If MCP cannot be represented without changing `ToolRegistry` or `McpGateway`, **Rule 1 was
  incomplete** — the counterfactual admission test failed to anticipate a real external constraint.
  This is the single most likely place for the constitution to break, because MCP is a
  specification we do not control.
- If MCP requires the tool-execution path to bypass the registry, **invariant 2 was mis-scoped**.

**Expected outcome:** MCP arrives as one registry *backend*, plugging into both seams unchanged.

### OBSERVED
*Pending.*

---

## Evidence Record: RBAC — Type: Capability

### PREDICTION *(written before implementation, 2026-07-19)*

**Rules exercised:** Type A/Type B classification, Rule 5, GP-2.

**Falsification conditions**

- If RBAC introduces **any new Tier-1 protocol**, then either it was misclassified as a Capability
  milestone, or a foundational seam is missing. Both are valuable findings.
- If RBAC needs to modify `PipelineStage`, `RoutingDecision` or `BaseAgent`, **Rule 5 is triggered**
  and the milestone must stop before any code changes.

**Expected outcome:** RBAC consumes the pipeline, `AgentRuntime` and `RoutingDecision` seams and
introduces no new protocol. Authorization was deliberately sequenced *after* the agent runtime
precisely so it evaluates agents, tools and pipeline stages rather than only HTTP endpoints.

**Known watch item:** authorization checks fail the same way authentication guards did — a
permission check matching nothing is indistinguishable from one that passes. Every RBAC guard needs
a test proving it denies on known-bad input.

### OBSERVED
*Pending.*

## Completed (no prediction recorded — pre-dates this log)

| Milestone | Type | Rules exercised | Exceptions |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI OS Foundation (Slice 1) | Foundation | 1, 2, 3, 4 | None |
| Agent Runtime (Slice 2) | Foundation | 3, 4, 5 | Rule 5 triggered and satisfied; no ADR needed |
| **Tool Registry (Slice 3)** | **Foundation** | **4, 5** | **None — first pre-registered prediction; Rule 4 held** |

Both are recorded honestly as **weaker evidence**: their predictions were not written in advance,
so ✓ reflects hindsight rather than a binding test. Slice 2 has a full record above. Tool Registry
is the first milestone with a genuine, pre-registered prediction.

## Evidence Record - Phase 4 Slice 4: MCP Gateway

**Classification:** Foundation milestone. **Evidence strength: STRONG** - the prediction was
registered before any MCP code existed, and MCP is a specification we do not control, so the
seams could not have been shaped to fit it after the fact.

**Pre-registered prediction.** An external protocol (MCP) can be integrated by implementing the
existing `McpGateway` and `ToolRegistry` seams without changing either protocol.

**Primary falsification condition.** If implementing MCP requires changing `McpGateway` or
`ToolRegistry`, Rule 1 is falsified and Rule 5 is triggered.

**Outcome: prediction held. Rule 1 HOLDING. Rule 5 NOT TRIGGERED.**
`ports/mcp.py` and `ports/tools.py` are byte-identical to their Slice-1 and Slice-3 state. Two
MCP gateway implementations (`NullMcpGateway`, `InMemoryMcpGateway`) and one consumer
(`McpToolProvisioner`) were built against them unchanged, and the consumer works identically
across both registry backends.

### The one condition that came close

The secondary condition *"MCP cannot be represented through existing `ToolDescriptor` semantics"*
was the only one that required a judgement rather than an observation. MCP describes a tool with
three fields; `ToolDescriptor` has six. The adapter supplies `version`, `capabilities` and
`required_permissions` from deployment-local knowledge.

Ruled **NOT TRIGGERED**: the adapter supplied deployment-specific domain metadata rather than
exposing a protocol deficiency. Recorded explicitly because "the adapter had to invent three of
six fields" is the kind of fact that should survive in the record even once it is ruled
non-firing - if a later external protocol forces the same judgement again, the pattern matters
more than either instance.

### Security finding promoted out of the mapping

`required_permissions` is not a defaulting decision, it is an authorization boundary. Had the
adapter accepted permission metadata from MCP, a remote server would declare its own
authorization bar and could lower it to nothing by omitting the field. The adapter therefore
never reads permission metadata from the server in any spelling, and a test asserts this against
a deliberately hostile server. This was discovered while writing the mapping documentation, not
while designing it.

The residual risk is recorded rather than solved: an **unconfigured** MCP tool receives `()`,
which `permitted()` treats as "no permission required". Deployment safety therefore rests on the
operator declaring requirements. A default-deny alternative was not adopted because it belongs to
RBAC, which is out of this slice's frozen scope.

### Enforcement (each violated, observed failing, restored, observed passing)

| Guard | Mechanism | Violation | Observed |
|---|---|---|---|
| D | import-linter | consumer imports `InMemoryMcpGateway` | 14 kept / 3 broken |
| E | import-linter | MCP adapter imports `InMemoryToolRegistry` | 15 kept / 2 broken |
| F | AST scan | consumer constructs `InMemoryMcpGateway` | exit 1, offender named |

Guard F is the **third** occurrence of import-linter being unable to express a construction
constraint. Two occurrences were a coincidence; three is a category. Dependency questions and
construction questions are structurally different, and every future seam should be assumed to
need both kinds of check unless shown otherwise.

### Finding: the two validation entry points have drifted

`validate.sh` contains none of the Phase-4 guards - not Guard F, and not the RoutingDecision or
registry guards from Slices 2 and 3 either. Gate 2 runs `validate.ps1`, so enforcement is real on
the machine that matters, but a guard present in one entry point and absent from the other is
half-enforced, and the earlier lesson of this project is that a check which cannot fail is worse
than no check because it reports success. Not fixed here: out of frozen scope. Logged as a
blocking item for the next slice.
